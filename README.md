May say my very first program apart from books. 
Original is lost. It's a back up in between. (don't know about version control @ that time ;) )
Uses Turbo C++ specific libraries. 
Only useful thing in this project is CUI using Turbo C++. 
Adding mouse support is trivial. 
Program doesn't function as it's currently. 
But UI should work. 
* CUI : Character User Interface.
